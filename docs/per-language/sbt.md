# sbt — `sbt-direct`

Per-workspace sbt coordinator. Default mode is **auto**: on `start`,
the coordinator probes `<workspace>/.bsp/sbt.json` and selects:

| detected state | selected mode | cold first call | warm call |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.bsp/sbt.json` present | `bsp` (persistent JVM) | 15-30s (JVM boot + BSP init) | **~130ms** |
| `.bsp/sbt.json` absent | `oneshot` (per-call subprocess) | 4-5s | 3-4s |

`bsp` mode is strictly faster whenever it's available. If your
workspace doesn't have `.bsp/sbt.json`, run `sbt bspConfig` once to
generate it — every subsequent `sbt-direct call` in that workspace
switches to the warm path automatically.

Override auto-detection with `SBT_DIRECT_MODE=bsp` (force; errors if
descriptor absent) or `SBT_DIRECT_MODE=oneshot` (force; useful only
for a deliberate test of the fallback path).

Prereq for either mode: `sbt` on `PATH`. `bsp` adds the one-time
`sbt bspConfig` step per workspace.

The bsp mode uses the Build Server Protocol (Scala-BSP 2.x). sbt writes
`.bsp/sbt.json` describing how to launch itself in BSP server mode; the
coordinator reads that descriptor, spawns the JVM, runs the BSP
`build/initialize` handshake, and keeps the process alive for the
coordinator lifetime. Every `call` rides the same JSON-RPC connection.

### Verified smokes (fixtures/scala-sbt, BSP mode)

- `sbt-direct start` under `SBT_DIRECT_MODE=bsp` — coordinator up in
  ~15s on a warm Ivy cache.
- `call build-targets {}` → 3 targets (`root`, `root-test`,
  `root-build`) with capabilities `{canCompile, canTest, canRun}`.
- `call compile {}` × 3 consecutive calls: 159ms / 196ms / 138ms;
  coordinator PID unchanged across all three (persistent JVM).
- `call test {}` → `{statusCode: 1, originId: "sbt-direct-test-<ts>"}`.
- `call run {target: "root"}` → `{statusCode: 1, originId: "sbt-direct-run-<ts>"}`.
- `call clean {}` → `{cleaned: true}`.
- `call sources {}` → 15 source-file entries across targets.
- `call dependency-sources {}` → classpath items including Coursier
  cache paths.
- `call reload {}` → result null (BSP workspace/reload).
- soft-reload on `touch build.sbt` mid-session → PID preserved,
  coordinator log shows `[sbt-direct] bsp workspace/reload`.
- error paths: `call run {}` (no target) → `{"error":"run requires
  exactly one target"}`; `call compile {target:"does-not-exist"}` →
  `{"error":"no build target matched \"does-not-exist\" (known:
  root, root-test, root-build)"}`.
- cold without `.bsp/sbt.json` → coordinator fatal log: `BSP
  descriptor not found at <ws>/.bsp/sbt.json — run 'sbt bspConfig'
  in the workspace first, or use the sbt-oneshot adapter`.

### Earlier attempt: sbt's own `sbt --client`

An adapter using sbt's proprietary thin-client transport (watching for
`target/active.json` + connecting via the ipcsocket) was tried first
and withdrawn. `active.json` isn't written reliably under
`-Dsbt.server.forcestart=true` across builds (tested against fixture +
a real Play 3 project — sbt boots cleanly, reaches shell prompt,
never writes the file). BSP sidesteps that entirely: `.bsp/sbt.json`
is created via the explicit `sbt bspConfig` task and the protocol
itself is documented + standardized across Scala build tools.

## Install prereq

```bash
brew install sbt            # or sdkman: sdk install sbt
```

## Workspace markers (walk-up order)

1. `build.sbt`
2. `build.sc` (mill)
3. `build.mill`
4. `project/build.properties`

## Invocation

```bash
sbt-direct start                                  # cwd walk-up
sbt-direct call task    '{"task":"compile"}'
sbt-direct call task    '{"task":"test","project":"core"}'
sbt-direct call task    '{"task":"assembly"}'
sbt-direct call reload  '{}'
sbt-direct call version '{}'
sbt-direct tools                                  # full surface

# multi-task fan-out (1 HTTP roundtrip + 1 tool_result)
sbt-direct batch-json '[
  {"method":"task","params":{"task":"compile"}},
  {"method":"task","params":{"task":"test"}}
]'
```

sbt verbs are project-grain (no per-file batch convenience). Use `batch-json` for multi-task fan-out — `enforce-batch-on-direct-call.py` PreToolUse hook blocks 2nd same-method `call` within 60s. Per-task envelope `{ok:true,value}|{ok:false,error}` so one failed task NEVER poisons siblings. Note: in oneshot mode each sub-task spawns its own `sbt` JVM; in bsp mode all sub-tasks ride one persistent BSP server. Cost is dominated by the worst-case sub-task duration since `Promise.all` runs them concurrently against the LSP child.

## Method surface

### oneshot mode

| method  | params                                   | result                                        |
|---------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| version | `{}`                                     | `{exit, signal, stdout, stderr}` from sbt --version |
| reload  | `{}`                                     | `{exit, signal, stdout, stderr}` from sbt reload |
| task    | `{task: "<name>", project?: "<module>"}` | `{exit, signal, stdout, stderr}` from `sbt <task>` or `sbt <project>/<task>` |

### bsp mode

Mapped to BSP 2.1.0-M1 methods. `target` accepts the build-target
displayName (e.g. `"root"`, `"root-test"`) OR the full
`file:///...#<name>/<conf>` uri.

| method              | params                                       | wraps                       |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| version             | `{}`                                         | workspace/buildTargets      |
| build-targets       | `{}`                                         | workspace/buildTargets      |
| compile             | `{target?: "<name>" \| "<uri>"}`             | buildTarget/compile         |
| test                | `{target?, filter?: "<fqcn>"}`               | buildTarget/test            |
| run                 | `{target: "<name>", args?: [string, ...]}`   | buildTarget/run             |
| clean               | `{target?}`                                  | buildTarget/cleanCache      |
| sources             | `{target?}`                                  | buildTarget/sources         |
| dependency-sources  | `{target?}`                                  | buildTarget/dependencySources |
| reload              | `{}`                                         | workspace/reload            |

Omit `target` to apply to all build targets. Compile returns BSP
`{statusCode}` (1 = OK, 2 = ERROR, 3 = CANCELLED).

## Timing

**BSP mode** (default when `.bsp/sbt.json` present):
- Cold (JVM boot + BSP init): 15-30s on a warm Ivy cache; 30-120s genuine from-scratch.
- Warm: ~130ms per call (persistent JVM; measured against fixture project, N=3 consecutive calls at 159/196/138ms).

**Oneshot mode** (fallback when `.bsp/sbt.json` absent): each `call` spawns a fresh sbt subprocess.
- first run on a fresh checkout: 30-120s (Ivy/Coursier resolution + Bloop generation on first compile).
- subsequent runs: 15-40s (JVM boot + sbt init + task execution).

Persistent-JVM adoption via sbt's thin client (`sbt --client`) would
drop warm calls to <200ms but requires ipcsocket native-library loading
from `$TMPDIR/.sbt/` which Claude's Bash sandbox denies (see "Sandbox
limitation" below).

## Invalidation matrix

| type | files                                                                   | action |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| soft | `build.sbt`, `project/build.properties`, `project/plugins.sbt`          | next call re-reads (no-op in one-shot mode) |
| hard | `.env`, `.env.local`, `.sbtopts`, `.jvmopts`                            | coordinator restart (wrapper re-spawns on next call) |

## Sandbox interaction

The JVM uses the macOS per-user tmp dir (`/private/var/folders/.../T/`)
for sbt's BootServerSocket regardless of shell `$TMPDIR`, and for
dependency-cache writes during Ivy / Coursier resolution. Claude
Bash default sandbox denies writes there. `scripts/install.sh` pre-
allows the dependency-cache paths automatically:

```json
"sandbox": { "filesystem": { "allowWrite": [
  "/private/var/folders/**/T/.sbt*/**",
  "/private/var/folders/**/.sbt/**",
  "~/.sbt/**",
  "~/.ivy2/**",
  "~/.coursier/**"
]}}
```

`allowWrite` is **not** sufficient for either mode on macOS. Both
`bsp` and `oneshot` load a native dylib at runtime:

- `bsp` loads `libsbtipcsocket*.dylib` (ipcsocket for persistent server).
- `oneshot` loads `libswoval-files*.dylib` (swoval file-watcher used by
  sbt's `FileTreeRepository` during project load).

Both extractions call `Files.createTempFile` under the per-user tmpdir
(`/var/folders/.../T/.sbt<digits>/swoval/...` or `.../sbtipcsocket/...`)
and then `System.load`. macOS sandbox-exec governs `dlopen` via
`process-exec*` policy, orthogonal to `file-write*`. Adding
`allowWrite` globs for the tmp path — including the realpath twin
(`/var/folders/**/T/.sbt*/**` alongside the `/private/var/folders/...`
prefix) — does NOT rescue the load; denial happens at dylib-exec time,
not at file-create time. Verified 2026-04-22 — both bsp (prior session) and
oneshot (this session with twin-prefix glob active) RED at same error
signature class.

Call sbt-direct with `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` for either
mode. There is no sandbox-compatible sbt path on macOS.

Verified GREEN 2026-04-22 with Claude Bash `/sandbox disabled`:
`SBT_DIRECT_MODE=oneshot sbt-direct call version '{}' <ws>` against a
real Play/Scala workspace boots sbt cleanly, resolves project +
runner versions, no dylib "Operation not permitted" in stderr.

## Future work

- Persistent-JVM adapter via sbt's `--client` thin-client path.
  Needs: sandbox bypass for the ipcsocket dylib extraction, adoption
  probe for externally-running `sbt shell` sessions, restart on hard
  triggers.
- Structured task output parsing (sbt's log events → structured
  JSON) so callers can distinguish warning vs error without regex.
